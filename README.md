## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Domino’s Pizza sales data using SQL to uncover trends in customer behavior, order patterns, pricing, and revenue distribution.
The analysis demonstrates the use of aggregations, joins, CTEs, window functions, ranking functions, and date/time operations for real-world business insights.


## 🎯 Objectives

**Database Setup** – Create and populate tables for orders, order details, pizzas, pizza types, and customers.

* order_details – details of items per order
* pizzas – pizza variations with size & price
* pizza_types – pizza name and category
* customers – customer demographics


## 🧰 Techniques Used

SQL features applied include:

* JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING
* CTE for modular queries
* Window functions (LAG, running totals, ranking)
* Date & time functions (DAYNAME, HOUR)
